                <head>About the Electronic Edition</head>
                <p>The Office of the Historian at the U.S. Department of State has embarked on a program to
                    release an ebook edition of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>
                    (<hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>) series, which was established in 1861. Far lighter and more portable
                    than printed editions of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>, the ebook edition offers the full content of each
                    volume and makes use of the full-text search and other reading features of most ebook
                    devices and applications, including bookmarking and note-taking. Unlike the web-based
                    edition of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>, the ebook edition, once downloaded, can be accessed even without
                    internet connectivity.</p>
                <p>In creating the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> ebook edition, we endeavored to maintain fidelity with the
                    original printed edition. One challenge in this respect is representing original page
                    numbers from printed editions in ebooks. For readers who need to cite material in this
                    ebook, we recommend citing document numbers instead of page numbers, since document numbers
                    are persistent, media-neutral identifiers. In older <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volumes (before the
                    subseries covering the Johnson administration), where cross references use page numbers
                    rather than document numbers, we append to each page number a bracketed list of the document
                    numbers that correspond to it.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian has worked to ensure that this ebook is error-free and works on a
                    broad range of devices. Please email <ref target="mailto:history_ebooks@state.gov?subject=FRUS%20ebooks%20Feedback&amp;body=Your%20e-reader%3A%0A%0AVolume%3A%0A%0AComments%3A">history_ebooks@state.gov</ref> with any feedback.</p>
